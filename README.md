# MeuHorario 2

MeuHorario 2 is a remake of the class enrollment simulator MeuHorario and is meant to help students of the Universidade Federal da Bahia to plan which classes they will attend every semester.

The original MeuHorario was built by Rodrigo Rocha in 2004 and can be accessed in http://meuhorario.dcc.ufba.br/.

### Dependencies and Running

  - `docker`
  - `docker-compose`

Just build the containers, `up` them and access `http://localhost:3000`.
For populating the database, just run the tasks in `lib/tasks/crawler.rake` in the order they appear in the file. You can run them as `rails crawler:task_name`. Running all crawler tasks takes a while, you can skip `discipline_infos` as it is the slowest and only provides the load in hours of the disciplines.
