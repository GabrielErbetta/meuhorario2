# MeuHorario 2

MeuHorario 2 is a remake of the class enrollment simulator MeuHorario and is meant to help students of the Universidade Federal da Bahia to plan which classes they will attend every semester. You can access it in https://www.meuhorarioufba.com.br/.

The original MeuHorario was built by Rodrigo Rocha in 2004 and can be accessed in http://meuhorario.dcc.ufba.br/index2.php.

If you need anything, just create an issue to get in touch. ðŸ˜‰

### Overhaul

I am very slowly rebuilding this project in place. This is the current status:

- [x] Containerization
- [x] Enviroment - Ruby + Rails + Other gems
- [x] Scraping
- [ ] Multiple Curriculums
- [ ] Cleanup
- [ ] Environment 2 (it's been so long since the first that i have to do it again)
- [ ] Control Panel
- [ ] Models
- [ ] Controllers/Routes
- [ ] API
- [ ] Visuals/Frontend

### Dependencies and Running

  - `docker`
  - `docker compose`

Just build the containers, `up` them and access `http://localhost:3000`.

For populating the database just run the rake task `scraper:all`. That runs all the scrape tasks needed.
If you want, you can run the tasks manually so you can skip `scraper:discipline_infos` as it is the slowest and only provides the load in hours of the disciplines.
